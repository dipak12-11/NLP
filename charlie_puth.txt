Woah-oh, hm-hmm

[Verse 1]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up (Ah)
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, huh

[Verse 2]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know that you won, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma (Dress is karma), perfume regret, yeah
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
(You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine)
And now I'm all up on ya (All up on ya), what you expect? (Oh, baby)
But you're not coming home with me tonight (Oh, no)

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new (One new)
Yeah, you just want attention (Oh), I knew from the start (The start)
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (Over you), oh

[Post-Chorus]
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (Over you)

What are you doin' to me? (Hey)
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin', love?)
What are you doin' to me?

We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore like we used to do

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Ooh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore like we used to do

Oh, we don't talk anymore like we used to do


[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lyin' next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then, I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Ooh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez, Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?

Oh, we don't talk anymore like we used to do
Like we used to do


[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth, Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's givin' it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't)
